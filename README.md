## Welcome to World Train, Fifestarr
Mr. Tippi Fifestarr, as conductor on a World Train, you are responsible for the experience of your passengers (VIP or not) and crew.

## Use-case and front-end

To make a catchy learning experience, we have a custom front-end and specific use case for these contracts that will be the first deployed!

## What use are smart contracts?

1. [World Train v0](./train.sol): TrainID, Track Conductor, Passengers
2. Passenger Ticketing Agent v0: Allow a passenger to buy a ticket (normal or VIP), or upgrade to VIP
3. World Train v1: Access Control allow Tippi to issue CREW_ROLE, which permits access to CheckIn in any car, Cars.
